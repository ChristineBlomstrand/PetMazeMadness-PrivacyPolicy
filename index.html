    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> November 3, 2025</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Pet Maze Madness ("we", "our", or "the app") respects your privacy. This
      Privacy Policy explains how we handle information in our mobile game
      application.
    </p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
      Pet Maze Madness does NOT collect, store, or transmit any personal
      information, user data, or sensitive information to external servers.
    </p>

    <p>The only data stored locally on your device includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Character Name:</strong> A custom name you choose for your
        in-game character (stored locally on your device only)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Game Settings & progress:</strong> App preferences such as game
        mode and game progress (stored locally on your device only)
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>
      All data is stored locally on your device using your device's local
      storage. This data never leaves your device and is not transmitted to any
      servers or third parties.
    </p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>

      Pet Maze Madness does not use any third-party analytics, advertising, or

      Our app does not collect any personal information from children under the
      age of 13 or any other age group. The app is designed to be safe for all
      ages, and no personal data is collected or transmitted.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>
      Since no data is transmitted from your device, your information remains
      secure on your device. If you uninstall the app, all locally stored data
      will be removed.
